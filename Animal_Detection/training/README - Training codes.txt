-DO NOT execute the training codes if the current PC does not have a dedicated GPU for Deep Learning. The code will never finish running without a GPU. 
**The author used NVIDIA RTX 2070.

-It is recommended to not execute the training codes because the current h5 files (the results) will be overwritten. The Tensorboard files will also be overwritten.

-The codes are all in Python. It is recommended to run them in Jupyter Notebook as all the results have been displayed in the interface without needing to execute the codes again.

-Ensure that all libraries are available with the EXACT versions shown in Appendix A in the Thesis in order to execute the codes. 

-It is recommended to install all libraries along with Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda from the website https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

-To execute the codes on Jupyter interface, simply use Shift + Enter.
