-It is recommendeded to not execute the conversion codes because the current pickle files (the results) will be overwritten.

-The conversion codes are "12 classes Data convert". Both codes provided are identical except for the resize function, CapsNet has 128x128 input, AlexNet has 227x227, the other networks have 224x224.  

-The codes are all in Python. It is recommended to run them in Jupyter Notebook as all the results have been displayed in the interface without needing to execute the codes again.

-Ensure that all libraries are available with the EXACT versions shown in Appendix A in the Thesis in order to execute the codes.
 
-It is recommended to install all libraries along with Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda from the website https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

-To execute the codes on Jupyter interface, simply use Shift + Enter.
